<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expanding metal stent market is categorized into three types: fully covered, partially covered, and uncovered stents. Fully covered stents are completely lined with a material, reducing tissue ingrowth but potentially increasing the risk of migration. Partially covered stents feature both covered and uncovered segments, balancing tissue attachment and migration risk. Uncovered stents, having no lining, allow for maximum tissue integration, ideal for certain conditions but may lead to higher risks of re-obstruction due to excessive tissue in-growth.</p></p>
